Running it
==========

The DDH is executed automatically by the operating system by means of crontab.

The first tab shows the DDH icons. It display the status of every feature is displayed there.
The second tab shows past plots. The first hardware button from the top at the side of the DDH
allows switching the logger the plots belong to. The third hardware button at the side of the DDH allows
switching the spain within the same plot of the same logger.
The third tab shows `more information`, which is useful for see loggers' history,
support purposes, knowing the last version of the software, etc.



As mentioned, the DDH requires no intervention of any kind from the user.
It will automatically display data plots when the files are downloaded from loggers,
upload such files to the cloud, keep a history log about them, etc.


.. note:

	If you ever need to reboot the DDH, go ahead and press the upside hardware power button. This is better than suing a `reboot` shell command, since allows the power hats to shutdown all properly. Same thing to shutdown the DDH completely.
