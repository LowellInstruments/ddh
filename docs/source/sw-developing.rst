Developing it
#############

The source code of the DDH is organized in a modular manner. We recommend looking at the
file `th_core.py` and all the DDH flow can be followed from it, since it is the starting
point of the software.

The whole `ddh` repo can be opened as a Pycharm project for the sake of convenience. Then,
a python virtual environment can be installed and a 'Run configuration' can be set to point
to `main.py`.
