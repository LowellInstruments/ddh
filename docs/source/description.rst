to aggregate data from wireless data loggers previously deployed in their operation areas.

The system works completely unattended, scanning and detecting nearby wireless loggers, and downloading, re-configuring
and setting them up for the next deployment in a completely automatic manner. The downloaded data is then uploaded
to cloud services. The entire system can operate without a single intervention from the user. However,
the interface also provides tailored capabilities to access real-time and historical data.

The DDH system is comprised by hardware and software parts, which we show and describe in the following sections.
